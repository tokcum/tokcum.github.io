Our venture to [become a software developer](/#what it takes to become a software developer)
is going to be long term so we need a lasting source of motivation to be successful in the 
long run. While extrinsic motivation tends to drive us only over a short period, 
intrinsic motivation can be an inexhaustible source of self-motivation as I experienced back 
in 2001.

At that time I started to study economics as a correspondence course in parallel to my 
daily job in IT. In general the planning interval for part-time studies is twice the time 
of regular studies, so I was prepared to spend eight to ten years.

To be honest, at that time my extrinsic motivation was the master's degree itself, and the 
positive impulses I anticipated for my career path. This wouldn't have kept an ailing firm 
afloat due to the fact that my career advanced quickly even without the master's degree. 
Figuring out my intrinsic motivation helped me to cope with e.g. attending lectures at the 
weekends, studying books late night after work and spending my holidays preparing for exams. 
Finally, I finished my studies successfully.

In short: intrinsic motivation is key for a long term venture to succeed.

From my experience intrinsic motivation is highly individual and contextual i.e. if you ask 
people about their intrinsic motivation related to their ventures it is unlikely you get 
the same answer twice. 
Still, the process to get clear about our intrinsic motivation can be similarly facilitated 
by thinking about _Mission_, _Vision_ and _Values_. Keeping these three clearly separated and 
concise from the beginning can be a challenge but is worthwhile because it strengthens 
the synthesis of the three in a _Guiding Principle_ which gives the venture 
a remarkable identity and everybody involved a coherent direction.

1. The mission expresses the purpose of our venture. _Why_ do we spend our valuable time and 
_how_ do we contribute to an overarching objective. In real live it encourages us to go the 
extra mile even in adverse conditions.
2. The vision encompasses the full picture. It determines long term objectives and 
portrays an ideal image of the venture in the future. It enables us to assess our everyday 
actions, decisions and priorities. Intermediate objectives help us as milestones gearing 
towards our vision.
3. Values guide our thinking and acting by governing our perception and situational 
awareness. Often we are assuming values implicitly. By expressing them explicitly we enable others 
to look at the world through our eyes for example or to better understand our basic conception 
of man.

Finally, here is my proposal regarding the mission statement, the vision and the values guiding 
this venture for the time being.


# Mission

Empower anyone to organically grow their knowledge and share it with the community.


# Vision

One day the today's approach to organize knowledge in multiple, often disconnected locations 
in an either patronizing hierarchical or chaotic unstructured manner is overcome by an approach 
putting the natural character of knowledge which is contextual, interlinked, undirected, 
distributed and associative into practice. 

The mental effort required to collect, to arrange, to search, to locate and to evaluate knowledge 
is simplified to an extent that it is virtually unnoticeable.

Sharing our knowledge with others is going to become a highly ranked value and an everyday activity. 


# Values

Regarding values I like the approach taken by the Agile Manifesto. All mentioned values are 
important, but the values on the left-hand side are rated higher compared to the values 
on the right-hand side.

1. Learning over Perfection.
2. Pushing the Limits over Convenience.
3. Simplicity over Design.
4. Diversity over Harmony.
