For sure, tools are key for our productivity as software developers. Time is long gone when 
we could compete with just a simple text editor and a compiler in our hands. At least since 
the rise of Agile and DevOps the scope has widened extremely. Today software developers also 
have to be knowledgeable in or at least have an understanding of: 

1. deploying of test and integration environments,
2. automated testing,
3. implementing continuous integration and delivery,
4. writing documentation,
5. leveraging infrastructure services,
6. supporting operations and 

   last but not least
   
7. managing projects and stakeholders.

Large scale projects are able to cope with this by deliberately compiled teams
so that all required fields of expertise are covered. It is a completely different story in 
smaller projects or with a less diversified set of team members. That is why I have defined 
the [project's 4th value](/project/2020/06/15/getting-started-mission-vision-values.html#forth value) 
regarding diversity.

Today there is a myriad of tools available to support our venture and with the maturing 
of Cloud offerings they are in reach within minutes. We could easily spend all day 
searching, evaluating and setting up tools by skimming through "best of" lists and tutorials.

Fiddling with tools may be fun but at the end of the day it does not help us much in becoming 
a software developer. That's why I follow the approach described below to take an informed 
decision allowing me to focus on the main task. At the same time I consider documented 
requirements factored into a comprehensible evaluation and thus leading to a transparent 
decision as an invaluable learning resource also providing a long-term orientation.


# Principles

To make sure tools are boosting and not killing productivity it is decisive to keep it 
simple by adhering to the following principles:

1. Focus on getting the job done.
2. Seek for "good enough" in favor of "the best ever".
3. Apply as many tools as necessary and as few as possible.
4. Avoid overlapping use cases and functionality.
5. Relate the maturity level required by the tool with the maturity of the team, project or organization.
6. Allow for future growth by thinking big but starting small.

Last but not least, do not believe in solving organizational and human issues such as missing 
common sense or friction between users with technical tools.


# Quality of the Decision

Before talking about requirements we have to think about the quality of the decision 
we are preparing. At the one end of the spectrum the scope is very limited i.e. one-time use, 
single user, or data is stored in a non-proprietary format. In this case a full-blown 
evaluation would be clearly over the top.

At the other end of the spectrum the scope involves a broad adoption throughout the organization, 
and the data stored uses proprietary formats leading to a potential vendor lock-in 
we need to take care of. Another differentiator between the two cases are license costs and 
recurring costs throughout the lifecycle.

For the further discussion let's assume we are somewhere in the upper half of this spectrum 
where it makes sense to elaborate our decision-making by defining and evaluating requirements.


# Requirements

I've experienced that people, at least in corporate environments, tend to give a never 
ending list of expectations, wishes and even dreams when asked for requirements a tool 
has to meet. Sometimes I even faced nonsense like "must be an enterprise ready solution".

Here is my attitude towards requirements keeping the principles defined above in mind:

1. Determine knockout criteria first. This approach is a fast track ruling out many options thus clearing sight.
2. Define today's requirements clearly and concisely. Avoid ambiguous statements.
3. Think out of the box to identify also future requirements.
4. Consider functional and non-functional requirements separately.
5. Check the license options available. In case it is not open source consider also the license model.
6. Examine the vendor especially regarding reputation, support offered, handling of bug reports 
and feature request as well as responsiveness to security incidents.   
7. Think also about your expectations regarding
 
   (1) deployment options
   
   (2) documentation
   
   (3) ecosystem
   
   (4) community

Do not hesitate to tailor the mentioned criteria according to your needs. This exercise 
ensures clarity about all crucial expectations thus providing the foundation for the evaluation. 


# Evaluation

In the past I leveraged sophisticated evaluations with hierarchically structured and weighted 
criteria rated with a scale between 1 and 5. From my experience this approach delivers 
surprisingly often insignificant differences between the top competitors. Another problem is 
that the chosen weights easily appear as arbitrary and are sometimes hard to justify.

That's why I recommend keeping the evaluation as simple as possible and take the decision 
based on a qualitative reasoning as opposed to a purely quantitative result.

Finally, we should challenge the decision for the last time by looking back at the 
principles defined above. Does it support us in getting the job done in an appropriately 
simple way? Is there a roadmap which allows us to grow beyond we know and act upon today? 
What would it take to adjust this decision in future?


# Reevaluation

From time to time people will question the chosen tools due to missing features, present 
bugs or some other annoyance. Sometimes they argue that changing the tool will solve these 
issues immediately. Our track of defined requirements and evaluations assists us in assessing 
this legitimate request also avoiding short-sighted responses.

By going through the previously defined requirements we check if they are still valid. If 
needed we take new requirements into account. Finally, we reevaluate the decision. In case 
there is an indication to change the former decision it is key to plan for a comprehensive 
change to avoid a tedious track of legacy tools in the long run.
