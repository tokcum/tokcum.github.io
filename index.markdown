This is about my journey to become a software developer. Yes, it is a late start. 
Most of my professional career in IT I spent on infrastructure, projects and 
operations, processes and leadership. In 2018, I gave it a new orientation 
by changing from IT over to Engineering.

I always felt comfortable writing my own scripts and glue code to automate 
systems. I liked to be in touch with software developers and to adopt agile 
methods in IT operations.

So, how hard might it be to actually become a developer working on software 
products on a daily base? For me it meant to leave my comfort zone. I wondered 
how I could approach the topic, how to climb a steep learning curve quickly 
and how to break it down into "digestible" pieces.

As I'm used to conducting trainings for professionals and to accompanying 
apprentices and students in their learning process, I thought about building 
upon my teaching experience by externalizing my own learning process in 
becoming a software developer.

My blog is about this journey. It aims to jump start your journey to become 
a software developer especially if you didn't start your career in this field. 
However, this is _not_ yet another blog about a programming language.

Learning and getting proficient in one or more programming languages is a 
necessary but not sufficient condition. Personally I think it needs much more 
to get successful in the long run.

We have to 

1. be creative about our vision and work on a attracting mission.
2. collaborate with others and share ideas amongst us.
3. master technology and tools.
4. define and follow our roadmap step by step.
5. become an active and respected member of the community.

Let's get started. Happy coding! ;)
